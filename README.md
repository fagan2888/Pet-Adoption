Yuwen analytical examples - 3/16/19 (see Yuwen analytical example branch)

Attached are some examples of the analyses we briefly discussed during lunch break. 

1. basic variable summary stat: see example summary-statistics.png, the items missing from that example table are: variable description, variable type (categorical, continuous), definition of each value for categorical variables, and number of missing
2. summary stat on continuous variables: 
       1. the histogram see example tasks_summary_stat.png, 
       2. distribution summary see example 11.03.gif
       3. scatterplot on Xi vs Y
3. summary stat on categorical variables (2x2 table): 2x2 table on Xi vs Y, see example con2.jpg
4. correlation matrix on all variables, including Y and all Xi, see example Image-8_correl-mat.png

Once we have some preliminary results on all those, we can group and discuss for the next step.
